could be helpful to keep an internal state to the kalman filter

don't know if I should do kalman update right after getting the new observation from vision

KF of EKF?

vision update itself when get_robot_pose or get_matrix is called

get_map from vision, only need backgoudn and obstacles

global planning shouldn't modify map

fix obstacle enlargement
